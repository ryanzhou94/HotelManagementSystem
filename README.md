# HotelManagementSystem

Introductio
Sunny Isle is a small but famous hotel in the east region of Lukewarm Kingdom. People from all over the world visit this place for a nice and comfortable holiday. Due to such popularity, the owner of the hotel decided to expand his hotel and adopt a new hotel management system (HMS) to ease the management process. You are the only one chosen to design and implement this HMS because the manager is not willing to pay more than one person. Apart from that, if you copy any code from others or let someone else develop this HMS, the manager will be disappointed and immediately report this to me. Plagiarism leads to a zero mark for this coursework.
The manager asked you to build a website that provides the following basic functionalities:
1.	Allow guests to book rooms or cancel room bookings.
2.	Allow hotel staffs to check the status of rooms, including current and future bookings.
You will need to apply all the knowledge that you acquired throughout the DBI course. The deadline is 4 pm on Wednesday, the 15th of May. Late submission will result in 3 marks loss per workday and you cannot submit after 4 pm on Monday, the 20th of May.
This assessment contributes 25% towards the overall module grade. Your submission will be marked on the school’s cslinux server. Subsequently, your code must work on the PHP and MySQL installations on cslinux. “It works on my machine” is not a valid argument when questioning your grade for this assessment. You will also need to include a clear reference document of your website, describing all functionalities.
Core Functionality
Below is the detailed description of the minimum functionality expected in the HMS. You must use this specification to develop the functionality of the system. You may apply your own judgement to any detail that is not precisely specified below.
The website must allow a guest to book a room or cancel a booked room. A registered guest will have a username, guest’s real name, passport ID, telephone number and email address. There is no current requirement for users to be able to update their details, but you may add this functionality if you wish. To log in, a guest is required to input his username and password correctly. Your website must also allow new users to be registered.
